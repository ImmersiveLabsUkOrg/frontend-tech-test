# Immersive Labs frontend technical test

This is the starter project for the Immersive Labs frontend technical test.

## Objective
Use the GitHub API to retrieve the public information about a user and display card based on the returned data. You can use your own username if you have one, or our Lead Frontend Developer's username `planetflash`.

## Tech
This project comes with Crate React App, but you are free to use any boilerplate you wish or to start from scratch.

At Immersive Labs we use the following tech stack:
- [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
- [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)
- [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
You are welcome to use any of these you wish, or completely different technologies, but be prepared to discuss your decision

The `src/theme.js` file contains some useful variables and colours you may wish to use.

## Time limit
Please try and limit yourself to two hours on this test. We want to see what you can do in a short period of time and what you are comfortable with. We are not looking to see how many hours you are willing to put in.

If you run out of time but there are other things you would have liked to implement, make a note of these to discuss with us, or let us know via the `readme.md` of your project.

## Submission
You can zip up your files and email them to [paul.thomas@immersivelabs.co.uk](mailto:paul.thomas@immersivelabs.co.uk) or submit via GitHub using a forked version of the repository and creating a pull request.

## Getting started
Assuming you are using the project starter files as they come (using Create React App):
- run `npm install` then
- `npm start`
- Head to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
If you're using a different boilerplate or your own setup - you're on your own!
