# Immersive Labs frontend technical test

This is the starter project for the Immersive Labs frontend technical test.

## Objective
- Use the GitHub API to retrieve the public information about a user.
- Display a profile card based on the returned data. This should user image and a summary of data retrieved.
- You can use your own username if you have one, or make it user searchable.
- You need not be a design guru, but we do love attention to detail, so some layout, basic styling and user considerations will all be looked favourably upon.

## Advanced
These are not part of the key requirements, but if they are too straightforward for you, or you just fancy showing off, here are some ideas for advanced features:
- Caching of results: The API is rate limited, if the lookup did not re-occur for a user whose data we've already retrieved this would improve user experience as well as reduce the number of lookups required.
- User Search: Allowing the user to search for a username rather than it being predefined will be a better user experience. Bonus points for making the search predictive.

## Enhancements
You are very welcome to enhance this functionality and make it as impressive and interactive as you like, but please do not exceed the time limit (2 hours, detailed below). Ideas for future enhancements can be discussed during the interview stage if not implemented during the test - we'd love to hear your ideas!

## Tech
This project comes with Create React App, but you are free to use any boilerplate you wish or to start from scratch.

At Immersive Labs we use the following tech stack:
- [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)

You are welcome to use any of these you wish, or completely different technologies, but be prepared to discuss your decision.

The `src/theme.js` file contains some useful variables and colours you may wish to use if you are working with css-in-js.

## Time limit
Please try and limit yourself to two hours on this test. We want to see what you can do in a short period of time and what you are comfortable with. We are not looking to see how many hours you are willing to put in.

If you run out of time but there are other things you would have liked to implement, make a note of these to discuss with us, or let us know via the `readme.md` of your project.

## Submission
You can zip up your files and email them to [paul.thomas@immersivelabs.co.uk](mailto:paul.thomas@immersivelabs.co.uk) or submit via GitHub using a forked version of the repository and creating a pull request.

## Getting started
Assuming you are using the project starter files as they come (using Create React App):
- run `npm install` then
- `npm start`
- Head to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
If you're using a different boilerplate or your own setup - you're on your own!
